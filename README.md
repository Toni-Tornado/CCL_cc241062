      Dear diary,
      today, i struggled. :,)
      I fixed a problem and created another, as one does in life. I managed to fix the issue I had with my player character not showing up, and got started on my projectile shooting mechanics. 
      Whenever I feel stuck w coding I start working on my game's artwork :,) (which was many times today.)
      
      my goal for tomorrow is to finish the shooting mechanics and some(or most) of my artwork.

      10:45 ok my projectiles exist. now onto figure out how to make them come from the player position. :,)
      
      11:50 it works! my player character can now shoot (only in one direction but whatever), and there are multiple projectiles that appear when the button is pressed :))
      
      13:25 shoutout to dejan for helping, i can now fire in my facing direction yay!!
            however, whenever projectiles are still on screen, they still turn according to my facing direction boooo!! :(
      
      16:12 i started working on my sprites at home

      Today, I basically only worked on my artwork, because I was kind of stuck with coding.
      I started working on my sprites for my main character and on my enemy sprites.
      My enemy's collision w the projectiles, player and walls work well :)
      now onto randomizing the movement :,)
      Fixed my projectile issue

      Problems for today:
      - fix the player being able to go out of bounds
      - figure out how to spawn multiple waves of enemies
      - give enemies random movement
      - figure piskel out :,,,) (and finish the enemy spritesheet)
      - fix projectile firing while the player is dead
