## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Design:** Designing the Character Sprites was a lot of fun!
- **Consistency:** I stuck to the idea I had from the beginning on, and I made a playable game! YAY!

### Challenges:
- **Time Constraints:** I had a difficult time implementing more complex gameplay due to the limited timeframe.
- **Bug Fixes:** I had a tough time fixing bugs on my own, and had to ask for help for a lot of them. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to fix the player sprites bug. :(

### Lessons Learned:
- **Time Management:** Managing my time efficiently, in order to not get stressed out too much toward the end of CCL was so much more important than I anticipated.
- **Problem Solving:** I feel like this CCL was a great lesson in problem solving. Encountering problems and solving them creatively proved to be very useful.
