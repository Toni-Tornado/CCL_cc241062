14.01 Dear diary,

today, i struggled. :,)
I fixed a problem and created another, as one does in life. I managed to fix the issue I had with my player character not showing up, and got started on my projectile shooting mechanics. 
Whenever I feel stuck w coding I start working on my game's artwork :,) (which was many times today.)

my goal for tomorrow is to finish the shooting mechanics and some(or most) of my artwork.

10:45 ok my projectiles exist. now onto figure out how to make them come from the player position. :,)

11:50 it works! my player character can now shoot (only in one direction but whatever), and there are multiple projectiles that appear when the button is pressed :))

13:25 shoutout to dejan for helping, i can now fire in my facing direction yay!!
      however, whenever projectiles are still on screen, they still turn according to my facing direction boooo!! :(
