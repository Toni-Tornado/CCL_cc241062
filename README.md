14.01 Dear diary,

today, i struggled. :,)
I fixed a problem and created another, as one does in life. I managed to fix the issue I had with my player character not showing up, and got started on my projectile shooting mechanics. 
Whenever I feel stuck w coding I start working on my game's artwork :,) (which was many times today.)

my goal for tomorrow is to finish the shooting mechanics and some(or most) of my artwork.
